# MultiLoader Minecraft Mod (Forge + Fabric)

This repository contains the source code for a Minecraft mod that supports both **Forge** and **Fabric** loaders using the same codebase.

## Why use one repository for both?

Maintaining one codebase with separate loader-specific parts allows you to support both major modding platforms, reducing duplicated code and simplifying releases.
